The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow

Custom Rain (Arena Version)

Custom Snow (Sleet)

Remove Rain Splashes

Remove Some Other Particle Effects

Most Other Particle Effects Have Been Moved to mxsxc1_patricles, others are in mxsxc1_ghostpak

Notes/Issues:

Can be intensive and cause slow down. This is much much improved from the High Res Version, for use with the Arena & PVP.

The rain can look a little thick, this is improved on again in High Res Version.

This has been tested in Vanilla and with multiple shaders used by The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow, and in the insanity of The Arena.

This version deliberately uses blurred images with additional, barely seen, Alpha "residue" around the flakes.

This is entirely deliberate as it looks awesome in some packs, and produces the "sleet" effect. But in some cases it wont be wanted, and looks awful with a few shaders.

Another version of pack with Crisp Snow doesn't have this.

Alternate Weather Packs:

Pink Rain (only really works in Vanilla). Other colours and colour selection may be added later.

Crisp Snow. Minimal Alpha removed the Sleet effect.

Giant Snow. Huge Snow Flakes.

High Resolution Snow. Can be insanely intensive at times, but much better quality. Only really used for short scenes or image captures.

Downpour - Very Heavy Rain

Dancing Through Rainbows - This Is Crazy & Can Make You Feel Sick - Not quite sure have a use for it so low priority.

The Dark Is A Cold Lonely Shadow

We are looking at publishing to Modrinth. We are under no circumstances going to look into Curse/Forge/Overwolf - unless they mend their ways. Then again we did produce TechnoPiggy, and are considering giving him wings...
